Cursor Website Clone (HTML + CSS)

A static clone of the Cursor website built using pure HTML and CSS to strengthen frontend fundamentals.
This project focuses on layout building, positioning, and recreating a real-world UI without using frameworks or component libraries.

About the Project

This clone was created as part of foundational frontend practice. The goal was to understand how complex modern websites are structured and styled using only core web technologies.
No JavaScript frameworks, no UI libraries — just clean HTML and CSS.
